# Code of Conduct

We, as contributors and maintainers of the Status Saver project, pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- **Being respectful**: Disagreements happen all the time. You should focus on the issue, not the person.
- **Being inclusive**: Everyone is welcome, regardless of their background.
- **Being understanding**: Not everyone will agree with your decisions, but try to understand different perspectives.
- **Being patient**: Processes may take time. Be patient and give people the time to voice their opinions.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- **The use of sexualized language or imagery**
- **Personal attacks**
- **Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments**
- **Public or private harassment**
- **Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission**
- **Other unethical or unprofessional conduct**

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [geekforgeeks222@gmail.com](mailto:geekforgeeks222@gmail.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership.
